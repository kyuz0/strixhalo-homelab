# Static SH wiki generator
Builds a fully static, interlinked set of HTML pages from the wiki markdown
in the repo root. Output goes to `.static/dist`.

## Usage
```sh
cp .env.example .env # and edit it
cd .static
npm install          # first time
npm run build        # -> dist/
```

## What gets generated
- One `.html` page per `.md` wiki page, mirroring the repo layout
  (`Guides/Buyer's_Guide.md` -> `dist/Guides/Buyer's_Guide.html`).
- `dist/index.html` is the home page (built from the root `README.md`);
  with `CLEAN_URLS=true`, each non-home page is instead emitted as a directory
  index (`Guides/Buyer's_Guide/index.html`) and linked with a trailing slash.

## Serving clean URLs
With `CLEAN_URLS=true`, each page is emitted as `key/index.html` and linked as
`key/`. This is compatible with static hosts, including GitHub Pages, because
the host serves the directory's `index.html` without a rewrite rule.

## Link rewriting
| Source link | Generated |
| ----------- | --------- |
| `./img.png` (attachment relative) | `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/{GH_REPO}/repo/path/to/img.png` |
| `../Other_Page.md` | relative `.html` link (or directory URL with `CLEAN_URLS=true`) |
| `https://…` | unchanged |
| `#anchor` | unchanged |
| `../Some/Dir/` | relative dir link (trailing `/`) |
| `[[alias\|Target]]` (OtterWiki) | `[alias](relative .html)` |

`?thumbnail` query strings (OtterWiki thumbnails) are respected via applied styling.

All attachments (images, PDFs, firmware ROMs, …) are linked as raw GitHub
copies of the configured repo. The raw URL base is derived from `GH_REPO` as
`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/{GH_REPO}/` (`HEAD` is substituted when no
branch is given, resolving to the default branch); "View on GitHub" links
use `https://github.com/{user}/{repo}/blob/{branch-or-HEAD}/`. Raw `.md`
files referenced in the wiki (e.g. via `[[...]]` or plain links ending in
`.md` that point to pages outside the wiki page set) also resolve under the
raw base.
